# A better LinkedIn chrome extension

Extension that shows your last 5 linked in messages and takes you to your inbox.

I created it because the current official LinkedIn extension does not do much (or anything)
as of Dec 28th 2017.

If you find it useful and want a new feature, create an issue or PR.

## Getting Started

Install from the chrome web store [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/linkedin-a-better-extensi/hhoajngapgiljoippffaaabidedifape?hl=en).

![Preview](/.store/screenshot.jpg?raw=true "Preview")

## Usage

The extension displays the 5 most recent messages from your inbox.

It requires you to be logged in linkedin.com but you can use the extension from any tab.

When you aren't logged in, you will be taken to the LinkedIn log in page.

If there's no messages, a message saying so is shown.
